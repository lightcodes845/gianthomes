                        <p>Giant Homes was established in 2011.
                            With a wealth of experience spanning 50 years, we are dedicated to providing beautiful
                            quality homes, built to the highest standard. We strive to exceed expectations, considering
                            our clients throughout the design process to create homes of distinction.</p>
                        <p>We appreciate that value for money without compromising on quality is important. As with all
                            businesses there is a need to know that the product being purchased fulfills those
                            requirements. We are well versed in all aspects of residential home building and are able to
                            offer a traditional, off-plan or ‘custom build’ purchase.</p>

                        <p>
                            Here at Giant Homes we offer a unique option, perfect for our clients who want
                            more input into their home. On selected developments we offer the client the ability to
                            purchase their dream plot and construct their dream home. The Custom Build process is less
                            stressful than traditional self build as we take full control of all the technical decisions
                            and planning issues that would normally be associated with building a property, leaving the
                            client free to concentrate on all the exciting choices.
